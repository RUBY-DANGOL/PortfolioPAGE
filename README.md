I created a web application called portfolioPAGE as a practice project in HTML, where I've designed a portfolio showcasing my personal details. Users can navigate through the site to learn more about me and can fill out a contact form to leave their email address for any inquiries. The frontend is currently developed, but the backend is still in progress. The portfolio includes sections for my educational background, displaying academic results, as well as other areas like work experience, projects and skills. Additionally, users can click on my profile picture to access my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.
