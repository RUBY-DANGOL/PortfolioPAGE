                    Hi there! I'm Rubina Dangol Maharjan, a tech enthusiast living in the bustling city of Kathmandu. I'm currently pursuing a BTech in Artificial Intelligence at Kathmandu University, where I recently completed my first year.During this time, I had the opportunity to work on some exciting projects,including my semester project, Feather Finder—a bird classification model that was both challenging and incredibly rewarding.I'm passionate about AI and its potential to positively impact society. I believe that AI can be future -proof and help us make better decisions.I'm also interested in exploring the intersection of AI and social being.
                    
                    At the moment, I’m learning web development and experimenting with HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a fun project called portfolioPAGE, where I’m building my own little space on the web. It’s been a great way to mix creativity with code, and I’m enjoying every bit of it.
                    
                    When I’m not coding or working on AI projects, you’ll probably find me doing something creative. I love singing, dancing, painting, and diving into various DIY projects. Animals hold a special place in my heart, and I adore dogs, cats, snakes, and even geckos!
                    
                    As for sports, I’m not exactly an athlete—my pain tolerance is a bit too low for the rough and tumble. But hey, everyone has their strengths, right? For me, it's more about the joy of creating, exploring tech, and spending time with the furry (or scaly) friends that I adore.
                    
                    Thanks for stopping by to learn a little bit about me! Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to grow, learn, and share my journey in the world of AI and beyond.
