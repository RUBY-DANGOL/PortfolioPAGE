                        <li>Me and my teammates used python and tensorflow  to create a feather finder model that can identify different types of bird species. we trained transfer learning models(VGG16, Resnet121, Densent121) in our dataset of 62 birds. we ensembled it to a model and deployed in a web application using FastAPI.</li>

                            "I created a fun project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project includes a dashboard with a smooth scroll feature that takes users to different sections, such as 'About Me,' where users can get to know me better, as well as sections for 'Education,' 'Experience,' 'Skills,' and 'Contact.' In the 'Contact' section, users can leave their contact details, allowing me to reach out and offer guidance if needed. I also included a reference section to make it easier for others to build a similar portfolio, along with 'Before' and 'After' videos showcasing the portfolio's transformation.

                            I created a web application using HTML and CSS. This is a fun project to practice HTML and CSS. It is a simple yes or no application
                            where user have to reply either yes or no but the fun part is when the user tries to press no button, the no button will move and you can not press no button, therefore you will have to press yes. It is a website to ask your partner if they love you or not.
