        <li>Feather Finder</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Me and my teammates used python and tensorflow  to create a feather finder model that can identify different types of bird species. we trained transfer learning models(VGG16, Resnet121, Densent121) in our dataset of 62 birds. we ensembled it to a model and deployed in a web application using FastAPI.</li>

                I  created a simple portfolio page using only HTML. It has a navigation bar, a education section, a about section, a project section, a experience section,  a skill section and a footer section. User can click on my profile and navigate to a contact section. It is responsive and looks good on all devices.

                I created a web application using HTML and CSS. This is a fun project to practice HTML and CSS. It is a simple yes or no application
                where user have to reply either yes or no but the fun part is when the user tries to press no button, the no button will move and you can not press no button, therefore you will have to press yes. It is a website to ask your partner if they love you or not.
